# ðŸ§  Stroke Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on medical and lifestyle features. It demonstrates how data science can support early detection and prevention efforts in healthcare using accessible and structured data.


# ðŸ“Œ Introduction
Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Early identification of high-risk individuals is critical to prevention. This project builds a machine learning classification model that predicts stroke risk based on patient data such as age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, etc.

Leveraging supervised learning and model evaluation techniques, I aim to create a pipeline for clinical decision support systems or health screening.
